# Windows networking tools

Windows networking tools introduced:
- `ipconfig`: Check local network interfaces and informations
- `ping`: Test if a destination is reachable
- `tracert`: Check what is the routing between the source and the destination
- `nslookup`: Lookup the IP address for a DNS record
- `netstat`: Show active connections
- `route`: Routing table related functions
    - Persistent route: makes a route persistent across boots of system

I'm using my local computer to complete this home work. There are mainly two network interfaces that are of interesting in my local environment, one for the wifi connection and one for WSL. The wifi network interface is the one that will be used in this home work to connect to destinations using different commands in below

```

I pinged google.com in this section, which shows:

- IPv6 is being used
- There are four packets that were being sent and received back successfully
- Each packet contains 32bytes data
- The RTT is about 30-40ms

## Trace Route

Trace complete.
```

The trace route result shows:

- There are 7 hops between my local environment and google.com
- The first two hops are likely my local ISP
- From the third hop onward the latency had increased
- There are some `*` entries, which might because the probe packet gets dropped or blocked

Thre are mainly two types of connections:
- The local loopback connections (the ones with source address of `127.0.0.1`)
- The external https connections (the ones with source address of `192.168.1.6`)

Apart from the obove, we can see that:
- For the external connections, my local PC uses random chosen ports for connection
- Most of the connections are secure https connections

The result shows IPv4 and IPv6 route tables in my local environment
- The default gateway in my case is `192.168.1.1`, combine with the fact that my local network submask is `255.255.255.0`, the router takes the first available IPv4 address
- There is no persistent routes in my local PC, simply because I've never touched it ðŸ’©
